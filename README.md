Introduction
============
This is a simple script that tells you how much DOGE you can buy with an 
amount of BTC.


Usage
=====
`./doge.py .0018`

The script will then pull the current rate of DOGE to BTC from Cryptsy
and print out how much doge you can buy at the current rate. It will also
print out the average and median price of the last 100 trades.
